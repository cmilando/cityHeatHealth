\title{The 'cityHeatHealth' package.}
\description{
Tools for estimating heat-related health impacts using daily exposure and
outcome data at small spatial scales. The package supports one-stage
conditional Poisson models, two-stage meta-analytic designs, and spatial
Bayesian approaches that borrow strength across neighboring geographic
units when case counts are small. Methods include distributed lag
non-linear models and attributable number calculations, with workflows
designed for messy real-world epidemiologic data.
