\description{
A town-level population dataset for Massachusetts derived from the
American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates. Populations are
aggregated by sex (Male, Female) and broad age groups (0--17, 18--64,
65 and older) for all Massachusetts cities and towns.
}
\details{
Geographic units correspond to Census \emph{county subdivisions (COUSUB)},
which align with cities and towns in New England states. This dataset
includes all 351 Massachusetts cities and towns.

Population estimates are based on ACS table \code{B01001} (Sex by Age)
and were aggregated from Census age bins into three broad age groups
commonly used in public health analyses. Estimates represent pooled
5-year ACS values and are subject to sampling error.

This dataset is suitable for use as denominators in rate calculations,
age-stratified analyses, and small-area public health modeling in
Massachusetts.
