Title: Estimating Heat-Health Impacts at Small Spatial Scales
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Chad", "Milando", , "cmilando@bu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
    Tools for estimating heat-related health impacts using daily exposure and
    outcome data at small spatial scales. The package supports one-stage
    conditional Poisson models, two-stage meta-analytic designs, and spatial
    Bayesian approaches that borrow strength across neighboring geographic
    units when case counts are small. Methods include distributed lag
    non-linear models and attributable number calculations, with workflows
    designed for messy real-world epidemiologic data.
